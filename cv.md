### Briefly About Myself:
*I started being interested in web development at the age of 11, as soon as I got my first computer with Internet access. I have always been interested in working with pages on the Internet. That's why I started learning html at school. Over time, I came to the conclusion that this is what I want to do professionally.*

*My interest led me to enter the university for a technical specialty, where I mastered C++. Then, I started studying JavaScript and other related technologies for working with web pages in courses.*

*At the moment, I'm graduating from university and I want to start my dream job. I am very hardworking, pedantic and very fond of learning new things. This desire was expressed as a child, when I constantly installed mods in video games and liked to study the structure of applications and "Mod-loaders".*
